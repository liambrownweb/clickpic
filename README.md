clickpic
==============

This is clickpic. It offers you the ability to create and manage multiple "photo tours" of buildings, properties, or anything else you might care to show on the Web.
Clickpic uses node.js, so its back-end is lightweight and quick. It uses HTML5, so the frontend is responsive and friendly. It's licensed under the GNU General Public License, so you're free to use it however you choose with few restrictions.
Clickpic is also under heavy development. Consequently, none of the above is guaranteed--except for the part about the license.
